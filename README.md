# Pizza_Sales_Dashboard

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: a PowerBI Dashboard on Pizza Sales! 🍕

I’ve combined my SQL skills with the powerful visualization capabilities of PowerBI to create an interactive dashboard that offers deep insights into pizza sales data. Here’s what I’ve worked on:

🔹 **Data Extraction & Transformation**: Using SQL, I extracted and transformed raw sales data to prepare it for analysis.

🔹 **Interactive Visualizations**: The dashboard features various charts and graphs that provide a detailed view of sales trends, customer preferences, and regional performance.

🔹 **Key Metrics**: 

 - Total Sales and Revenue
 - 
 - Sales by Pizza Type and Size
 - 
 - Customer Preferences
 - 
 - Monthly Sales Trends
 - 
This project has not only helped me strengthen my technical skills but also provided valuable insights that could drive strategic decisions in a real-world business scenario.
